# Traveling and Abroad #


![traveling](/img/about/traveling.jpg)


I was inspired Alex MacCaw's article [Traveling, Writing and Programming](http://old.alexmaccaw.com//posts/traveling_writing_programming) 3 years ago. I started to desire to go to abroad then. Though I couldn't speak English well, I made a plan to learn Englsih and going abroad. As a result, I'm learning English in the Philippines now. After school, I'm going to Thailand for vacation and programming this summer. 2014's autumn, I'm going to find a job in Canada.

# Life in Japan #


![gekkhouse](/img/about/geekhouse.jpg)


I lived in "Geekhouse", a share-house what lives many programmers in Japan for 2 years. I used to organized Unity game developer's event in the house. Particularly, [global game jam 2013](http://2013.globalgamejam.org/sites/2013/geekhouse-musashikosugi) was the most interesting event I've ever organized. Not only that, we sometimes held a party to talk about technology, buisiness and our hobby(anime, manga) with others.

# My Hobby #


![boardgame](/img/about/boardgame.jpg)


Board game is the most interesting game that I've ever played. When people play board game, they can be friend easily. I also like to think about tactics and rule of the board game. It makes my mind active!
